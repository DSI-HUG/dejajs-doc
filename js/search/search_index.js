love for you to contribute to DEJA-JS and help make it ever better!\nAs a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:\n\nQuestion or Problem?\nIssues and Bugs\nFeature Requests\nSubmission Guidelines\nCoding Rules\nCommit Message Guidelines\n\n Got a Question or Problem?\nPlease open an issues with the label : question.\n Found an Issue?\nIf you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by\nsubmitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository][github]. Including an issue \nreproduction (via CodePen, JsBin, Plunkr, etc.) is the absolute best way to help the team quickly\ndiagnose the problem. Screenshots are also helpful.\nYou can help the team even more and submit a Pull Request with a fix.\n Want a Feature?\nYou can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our [GitHub\nRepository][github]. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with\na proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it. \nPlease consider what kind of change it is:\n\nFor a Major Feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be\ndiscussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,\nand help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.\nSmall Features can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request.\n\n Submitting an Issue\nBefore you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.\nIf your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.\nHelp us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new\nfeatures by not reporting duplicate issues.  Providing the following information will increase the\nchances of your issue being dealt with quickly:\n\nOverview of the Issue - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps\nAngular and DEJA JS Versions - which versions of Angular and DEJA JS are affected\n  (e.g. 1.0.1)\nMotivation for or Use Case - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior\n  is a bug for you\nBrowsers and Operating System - is this a problem with all browsers?\nReproduce the Error - provide a live example (using [CodePen][codepen], [JsBin][jsbin],\n  [Plunker][plunker], etc.) or a unambiguous set of steps\nScreenshots - Due to the visual nature of DEJA JS, screenshots can help the team\n  triage issues far more quickly than a text descrption.\nRelated Issues - has a similar issue been reported before?\nSuggest a Fix - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be\n  causing the problem (line of code or commit)\n\n Submitting a Pull Request (PR)\nBefore you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:\n\nSearch GitHub for an open or closed PR\nthat relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.\nMake your changes in a new git branch:\n   git checkout -b my-fix-branch master\nCreate your patch, including appropriate test cases.\n\nFollow our Coding Rules.\nTest your changes with our supported browsers and screen readers.\nRun the test suite : npm test\nCommit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our\ncommit message conventions. Adherence to these conventions\nis necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.\n   git czNote: You need to install commitizen first : http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/\n\nPush your branch to GitHub:\n  git push my-fork my-fix-branch\nIn GitHub, send a pull request to deja-js/component:dev.\n\nIf we suggest changes then:\n\nMake the required updates.\nRe-run the test suites to ensure tests are still passing.\nRebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull\nRequest):\ngit rebase master -i\ngit push -f\n\n\n\nThat's it! Thank you for your contribution!\nAfter your pull request is merged\nAfter your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes\nfrom the main (upstream) repository:\n\nDelete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as\n  follows:\n  git push my-fork --delete my-fix-branch\nCheck out the master branch:\n  git checkout master -f\nDelete the local branch:\n  git branch -D my-fix-branch\nUpdate your master with the latest upstream version:\n  git pull --ff upstream master\n\n Coding Rules\nTo ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:\n\nAll features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests).\nAll public API methods must be documented. (Details TBD).\nWe follow [Google's JavaScript Style Guide][js-style-guide], but wrap all code at\n100 characters.\n\n Commit Message Guidelines\nSince 05.10.2017, we have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to more\nreadable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.  But also,\nwe use the git commit messages to generate the change log.\nCommit Message Format\nThe commit message must respect this format that includes a type, a scope and a subject:\n(): The header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.\nAny line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier\nto read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.\nType\nMust be one of the following:\n\nfeat: A new feature\nfix: A bug fix\ndocs: Documentation only changes\nstyle: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing\nsemi-colons, etc)\nrefactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\nperf: A code change that improves performance\ntest: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests\nbuild: Changes that affect the build system, CI configuration or external dependencies      (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)\nci: Configuration files\nchore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files\nrevert: Revert another commit\nquiet: Not documented in readme.md\n\nScope\nThe scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example\nDejaDatePicker, DejaMonacoEditor, etc.\nSubject\nThe subject contains succinct description of the change:\n\nuse the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\"\ndon't capitalize first letter\nno dot (.) at the end\n\nBreaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two newlines.\nThe rest of the commit message is then used for this.\nA detailed explanation can be found in this [document][commit-message-format].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"dependencies.html":{"url":"dependencies.html","title":"package-dependencies - dependencies","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Dependencies\n    \n    \n        \n            @angular/cdk : 5.2.4\n        \n            @angular/material : 5.2.4\n        \n            angular2-text-mask : 8.0.4\n        \n            hammerjs : 2.0.8\n        \n            lodash : 4.17.5\n        \n            moment : 2.21.0\n        \n            monaco-editor : 0.10.1\n        \n            reflect-metadata : 0.1.12\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        Peer Dependencies\n    \n    \n        \n            @angular/animations : ^5.1.0\n        \n            @angular/common : ^5.1.0\n        \n            @angular/core : ^5.1.0\n        \n            @angular/forms : ^5.1.0\n        \n            @angular/http : ^5.1.0\n        \n            @angular/platform-browser : ^5.1.0\n        \n            @angular/platform-browser-dynamic : ^5.1.0\n        \n            @angular/router : ^5.1.0\n        \n            core-js : ^2.5.3\n        \n            rxjs : ^5.5.6\n        \n            zone.js : ^0.8.20\n    \n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"index.html":{"url":"index.html","title":"getting-started - index","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n@deja-js/component\nThis is the home for the Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève - DSI - Domaine Patient team's Angular2 components for Angular 2 and material. \nOnline demo : https://dsi-hug.github.io/dejajs-components\nIntro\nThis repository is a Angular2 components library and the the common utility functions, with a demo application to testing it.\nRequirement\nBefore you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:\n\n[Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.\nDepending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.\n[Yarn][]: We use Yarn to manage Node dependencies.\nDepending on your system, you can install Yarn either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.\n\nGetting started\nBegin by cloning the repository.\nAfter cloning, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.\nYou will only need to run this command when dependencies change in package.json.\nyarn or npm i \nTake a look at the src folder. All components and demo application are placed here. \nRunning demo app\nyarn start or npm start\nand navigate to http://localhost:5100.\nCleaning\nTo clean the directory before making a new fresh install\nnpm run clean\nLinking\nTo link the library to your project, just make the following commands from the root directory of your project\nyarn link @deja-js/component or npm link @deja-js/component\nand start your project with the --preserve-symlinks flag. For example\nng serve --preserve-symlinks --port 4100 --base-href /\"\nBuild\nTo build the library you can use the command npm run build and to build the demo npm run build:demo\nA folder dist will be created on the root directory for the library and the demo directory for the demo containing the bundles.\nYou can serve directly the dist folder in the demo directory.\nFor example with http-server\n npm i -g http-server\n http-server demo/dist\nFeature status and browsers compatibility:\n\n\n\nFeature\nWorking OnPush\nRequired / Disabled\nChrome 56\nEdge\nIE11\nFF51\nOpera Neon\nReadme and Demo\nNote\n\n\n\n\nAccordion\nyes\nN/A\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\navailable\n\n\n\nChips\nyes\nN/A\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\n@todo\n\n\n\nCircular Picker\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\navailable\n\n\n\nColor Picker\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\navailable\n\n\n\nColor Selector\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\navailable\n\n\n\nContent Editable\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\nyes\navailable\nNew line issue on IE11.
